# Welcome to our Repository!

Here you will find information on our projects, databases, APIs and other developments from our team

## Current Projects 

- [AMORA](https://github.com/lara-unb/amora): The Autonomous Mobile Robot Algorithms (AMORA) project aims to enable our Pioneer 3 robots to perform simple tasks autonomously. In order to do so, we plan to integrate state-of-the-art algorithms in path planning, navigation, SLAM, object recognition and others within the ROS framework.

- [CLARA](https://github.com/lara-unb/CLARA): A research and development project funded by Brazilian Ministry of Health for development of a medical robot for endoscope holding during laparoscopic surgery procedures. The robot moves the endoscopic camera according to surgeon commands by voice or a hand joystick

## Closed Projects 

## Platforms and equipments

- [Aramis](https://github.com/lara-unb/aramis): mobile robot platform based on Pioneer base, equipped with 3D Vision, GPS/INS data fusion system, sonar ring and WiFi. Software run on Linux and ROS. This repository commom to the three platforms used at LARA: Athos, Porthos and Aramis.

- [Kyle_XY_and Jesse_XX](https://github.com/lara-unb/Kyle_XY_Jesse_XX): small mobile manipulators used for teaching. 

- [Meka Manipulador](https://github.com/lara-unb/Meka): Meka is a compliant manipulator. The Meka repository aims to enable and prepare the Meka Robotics A2 Arm to be used in other projects which require a compliant robotic manipulator. In order to do that it is necessary to develop and implement control techniques, kinematics and dynamics for the robot. All that is being done using ROS, C/C++, python, V-REP and the A2 Arm provided codes.

## Databases

## APIs, libraries, software tools 

- [gDataLogger](https://github.com/lara-unb/gdatalogger): data logger library written in C language for real-time, multithreading projects. Samples for pthread, RTAI and XENOMAI. Data is saved in .mat file, allowing reading in Matlab scripts. 

- [gMatrix](https://github.com/lara-unb/gMatrix): Matrix data type and linear algebra functions in C language for real-time and embedded platforms. 

## Documents

The following links are from documents prepared by LARA users for other LARA users and the community.
