## Current Projects 

- [AMORA](https://github.com/lara-unb/amora): The Autonomous Mobile Robot Algorithms (AMORA) project aims to enable our Pioneer 3 robots to perform simple tasks autonomously. In order to do so, we plan to integrate state-of-the-art algorithms in path planning, navigation, SLAM, object recognition and others within the ROS framework.
- [CLARA](https://github.com/lara-unb/CLARA): A research and development project funded by Brazilian Ministry of Health for development of a medical robot for endoscope holding during laparoscopic surgery procedures. The robot moves the endoscopic camera according to surgeon commands by voice or a hand joystick
